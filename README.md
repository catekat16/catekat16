### Hi, I'm Caitlyn 👩🏻‍💻🌸✨ 

I'm a woman in finance who's a product designer at heart with software engineering skills.

✨ At my core, I'm passionate about building platforms to connect, support, and elevate people. My latest project _Sincerely,_ was inspired by the lack of deep social connections made through traditional social media platforms and by fond memories of writing and receiving long letters during summer camps. ✨ 

🎨 As an artist, I have explored various mediums of art, through my instagram art accounts @pen_doodles and @digi.adventure.

🍩 My mission with @pen_doodles was to create intricate artworks using just your everday pens. Through @pen_doodles, I launched a water themed drawing contest that saw 50+ submissions, got viral through drawing Ansel Elgort's character from Fault in Our Stars, and showcased smaller pieces of artworks that I drew to the delight of gradeschool children. 

🔮 My second dive back into my art hobby with @digi.adventure was my first time exploring the digital art medium. I was able to use tools that allowed me to create stunning pieces of art that were actually very simple and straightforward once broken down into components. How fitting is it that my latest and current pursuit of my lifelong love for art is through creating art for technology. 

🐚 My goal is to design ui that's beautiful to the eye, and enhance the usability of useful products. I strive for designs that will leave the user with memorable, genuine, and even playful, christmas advent calendar like experiences that they will want to keep coming back to. I strive to elevate even the most basic of app functionalities through the power of ui.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Flutter, Firebase for SwiftUI, Core ML Framework
- ✏️ Most frequently used tools in my toolbox: SwiftUI, UIKit, Figma, HTML, CSS, Adobe XD, JavaScript
- ❤️ What I love to see: diversity in tech and finance for minority students from disadvantaged backgrounds, beautiful ui, succulents on my desk
