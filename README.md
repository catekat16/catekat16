## Hi, I'm Caitlyn 👩🏻‍💻🌸✨ 

✨ I'm a woman in finance who's a software engineer and product designer at heart.✨

💻 At my core, I'm passionate about building platforms to connect, support, and elevate people. Currently, I'm working on developing <a href="https://www.foodfindsapp.com/">🍕 FoodFinds</a>, an app for college students to stay in the know about free food items floating around on campus. 👀  

🎨 As an lifelong artist, I have explored various mediums of art, through my instagram art accounts <a href="https://www.instagram.com/pen_doodles/">@pen_doodles</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/digi.adventure/">@digi.adventure</a>.

🐚 Now, my goal is to design ui that's beautiful to the eye, and enhance the usability of useful products. I strive for designs that will leave the user with memorable, genuine, and even playful experiences that they will want to keep coming back to. 

Check out my <a href="https://caitlynchen.com/">personal website</a> and <a href="https://github.com/catekat16/starcheck">design process</a> and join me on my journey!
