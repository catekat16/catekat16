## Hi, I'm Caitlyn 👩🏻‍💻🌸✨ 

✨ I'm a woman in finance who's a product designer at heart with software engineering skills.✨

💻 At my core, I'm passionate about building platforms to connect, support, and elevate people. My latest project _Sincerely,_ was inspired by the lack of deep social connections made through traditional social media platforms and by fond memories of writing and receiving long letters during summer camps.  

🎨 As an artist, I have explored various mediums of art, through my instagram art accounts @pen_doodles and @digi.adventure.

🐚 Now, my goal is to design ui that's beautiful to the eye, and enhance the usability of useful products. I strive for designs that will leave the user with memorable, genuine, and even playful experiences that they will want to keep coming back to. 

🌱 I’m currently learning Flutter and more SwiftUI <br>
✏️ Most frequently used tools in my toolbox: SwiftUI, UIKit, Figma, HTML, CSS, Adobe XD, JavaScript <br>
❤️ What I love to see: diversity in tech and finance for minority students from disadvantaged backgrounds, beautiful ui, succulents on my desk <br>
